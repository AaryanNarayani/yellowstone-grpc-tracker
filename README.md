# Yellowstone gRPC Solana Indexer/Tracker

Real-time wallet activity tracking on Solana, powered by **Yellowstone gRPC**.
Subscribe to any wallet and stream what it does as it happens.

### Actions it performs:

* **System Program Actions** (SOL transfers, account creations, etc.)
* **SPL Token Program Activity** (token transfers/mints/burns)
* **DeFi Actions**: `type: "SWAP" | "BUY" | "SELL"`

> **TODO:** Protocol identification (Orca/Raydium/Jupiter/Tensor/MagicEden, ‚Ä¶) with richer decode

---

## ‚ú® Highlights

* Zero polling: live gRPC stream
* Tracks multiple wallets concurrently
* Pluggable ‚Äúclassifier‚Äù so you can improve decoding over time

---

## üß∞ Requirements

* Node.js 18+
* A Yellowstone gRPC endpoint (e.g. Triton One / RPC Pool, QuickNode, Helius, eRPC, or self-hosted)
